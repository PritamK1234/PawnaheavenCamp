I want to implement OWNER DASHBOARD ↔ PROPERTY LINKING
using PROPERTY ID as the single source of truth.

Context:
- We have a main website where properties are listed
- Each property has a unique Property ID
- We also have a separate Owners Dashboard
- An owner named "Hrushi More" is already registered
- Owner has Property ID: 6389M

Goal:
When an owner logs into the Owners Dashboard,
the system should automatically fetch and manage
the property that has the SAME Property ID (6389M)
from the main website database.

------------------------------------------------
CORE RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------------------
- Use Property ID as the linking key
- DO NOT duplicate property data
- DO NOT change existing property schema
- DO NOT break existing admin or website logic
- This flow is for OWNER-SPECIFIC access only

------------------------------------------------
DATA LINKING LOGIC
------------------------------------------------
1. Owner record contains:
   - owner_id
   - owner_name
   - property_id (example: 6389M)

2. Property record already exists in main system:
   - property_id (same value: 6389M)
   - property details (name, type, price, availability, etc.)

3. When owner logs in:
   - Fetch owner profile
   - Read property_id from owner record
   - Query properties table using property_id
   - Fetch that property’s data only

------------------------------------------------
ACCESS CONTROL (CRITICAL)
------------------------------------------------
- Owner can ONLY:
  - View
  - Edit
  - Manage
  the property that matches their Property ID

- Owner must NOT:
  - See other properties
  - Edit other owners’ properties
  - Access admin-only controls

------------------------------------------------
OWNER DASHBOARD FEATURES (DATA-SCOPE ONLY)
------------------------------------------------
Owner can manage ONLY linked property:
- Edit property details
- Manage pricing
- Manage availability / calendar
- Upload images (if already supported)
- Update rules or descriptions (if existing)

All actions must update the SAME property record
used on the main website.

------------------------------------------------
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
------------------------------------------------
- Backend: use existing APIs or create scoped endpoints
- Example flow:
   GET /api/owner/me
   → returns owner profile with property_id

   GET /api/properties/:propertyId
   → fetch property data

- Authorization:
   - Validate owner session
   - Validate property_id match before allowing updates

------------------------------------------------
UI REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------
- Owners dashboard should automatically load property
- No property selection dropdown (single-property owner)
- Show Property ID clearly in UI (read-only)
- If property_id not found → show clear error message

------------------------------------------------
ERROR HANDLING
------------------------------------------------
- If owner has no property_id → show “Property not linked”
- If property_id does not exist → block access + log error
- If mismatch → deny update

------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT FINAL NOTE
------------------------------------------------
This task is ONLY:
- Property ↔ Owner linking
- Secure data fetching
- Scoped editing access

DO NOT:
- Redesign UI unless required
- Change business logic
- Modify admin permissions
