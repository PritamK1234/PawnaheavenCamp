Now they just want **strong legal protection clauses** on your:

* ✅ Terms & Conditions page
* ✅ Privacy Policy page

Since you are a **marketplace intermediary**, you must clearly state:

* You are NOT the property owner
* You are NOT responsible for on-ground incidents
* You only facilitate booking & payment collection

I’ll now give you **ready-to-copy legal clauses** you can paste into your website.
