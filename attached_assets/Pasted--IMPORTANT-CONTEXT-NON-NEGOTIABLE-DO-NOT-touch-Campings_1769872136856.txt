**IMPORTANT CONTEXT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

* DO NOT touch **Campings_Cottages Owner Dashboard**
* DO NOT change Admin Panel or Public UI logic
* This task is **ONLY for Villas Owner Dashboard**
* Reuse existing components & calendar logic wherever possible

---

# TASK: Villas Owner Dashboard – Align with Unit-Based Flow (with Villa-Specific Rules)

## OVERALL GOAL

Make the **Villas Owner Dashboard** internally follow the same architecture as Campings_Cottages (calendar, ledger popup, sync), **but with villa-specific behavior differences**.

Villa is treated as **a single fixed unit**, not multiple units.

---

## 1️⃣ Calendar & Prices Tab (Villas)

### Default Selection

* Villa must be **auto-selected by default**
* NO unit selector / NO unit tabs (villa = single unit)

### Calendar Cell Click → Ledger Popup (Villa-Specific Rules)

Popup UI should show:

**Header**

* Villa name (e.g. *Sanket Villa*)
* Selected date (e.g. *31 Jan 2026*)
* Capacity display:

  * `Booked / Available`
  * Example:

    * **Booked** → PURE RED
    * **Available** → PURE GREEN
  * Max capacity text shown separately (e.g. *Max: 5 persons*)

---

### Ledger Rules (IMPORTANT)

* Only **ONE entry allowed per date**
* After one entry is added:

  * “+ Add Entry” button becomes **disabled**
* Button becomes clickable **only if that entry is deleted**

**Entry Fields**

* Customer name
* Number of persons
* Check-in / Check-out (auto-pick selected date)
* Payment mode (online / offline)
* Amount

---

### Availability Logic (Villa)

* If entry exists → status = **BOOKED**
* If no entry → status = **AVAILABLE**
* This status must sync instantly:

  * Villas Owner Dashboard calendar
  * Admin panel
  * Public website availability

⚠️ No per-cell prices shown on Villas calendar
⚠️ Calendar is availability-focused only

---

## 2️⃣ Units Tabs (Villas)

* ❌ Units tabs MUST NOT exist
* ❌ No unit selector dropdown
* Villa behaves as a **single implicit unit**

---

## 3️⃣ Profile Tab – Villas (DIFFERENT FROM Campings_Cottages)

### Shared Fields (same as Campings_Cottages)

* Activities
* Highlights (What You’ll Love)
* Property Schedule
* Rules & Policies
* Description

### EXTRA Fields (Villas ONLY)

* Amenities
* Property Images (Upload / Update Gallery)

⚠️ These **extra fields must NOT appear** in Campings_Cottages Owner Dashboard

---

## 4️⃣ Sync & Safety Rules

* Availability status (Booked / Available) is the **single source of truth**
* No duplicate logic for villas vs units
* Do NOT affect:

  * Campings_Cottages owners dashboard
  * Campings_Cottages unit logic
  * Public booking flow structure

---

1) Villas as Single Units: The villa will be treated as a single, auto-selected unit with no unit selectors or tabs.
2) Availability-Focused Calendar: One entry per date, with a ledger popup for management. No per-cell prices.
3) Real-Time Sync: Status changes will sync across the Owner Dashboard, Admin Panel, and Public Site.
4) Profile Enhancements: Inclusion of villa-specific fields like Amenities and Property Images gallery.
5) Strict Isolation: No changes will affect the Campings_Cottages Owner Dashboard or existing unit logic.

## EXPECTED RESULT

Villa owners can:

* Manage availability with **one-tap daily ledger**
* Clearly see Booked / Available states
* Avoid overbooking
* Have perfect sync across:

  * Owner dashboard
  * Admin panel
  * Public site

---

**Proceed ONLY with Villas Owner Dashboard changes.**
Awaiting confirmation before implementation.
