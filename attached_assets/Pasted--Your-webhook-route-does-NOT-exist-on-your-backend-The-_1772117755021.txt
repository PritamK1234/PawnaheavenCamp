
Your `/webhook` route does NOT exist on your backend.

The 404 page clearly shows that when visiting:

```
/webhook
```

your server is not handling that route.

That is why Meta Platforms cannot verify your webhook.

---

# ✅ Why This Is Happening

You are likely:

* Using React frontend
* And your backend route is missing
  OR
* Your webhook route is defined in a different file
  OR
* Your backend is not running on the same server

Right now, your Replit URL is serving frontend pages, not backend routes.

---

# 🎯 What Must Happen

Your server must respond to:

```
GET /webhook
```

If it returns 404 → Meta verification will ALWAYS fail.

---

# 🔥 FIX (Node.js Express Example)

If you're using Node.js + Express, add this in your main server file:

```javascript
app.get("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  const VERIFY_TOKEN = process.env.VERIFY_TOKEN;

  const mode = req.query["hub.mode"];
  const token = req.query["hub.verify_token"];
  const challenge = req.query["hub.challenge"];

  if (mode === "subscribe" && token === VERIFY_TOKEN) {
    console.log("Webhook verified successfully");
    return res.status(200).send(challenge);
  } else {
    return res.sendStatus(403);
  }
});

app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  console.log("Incoming webhook:", JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

Then:

1. Save file
2. Restart server
3. Open `/webhook` again

Now it should NOT show 404.

# 🧠 Important Question

Are you:

* Using Express backend?
* Or is your Replit only running React frontend?

Because if it's only frontend, Meta cannot call your webhook.

You need backend running publicly.

---

# 🚀 If You Are Using React + Node (Separate)

Then your backend URL might be something like:

```
https://api-pawnahavencamp.replit.app
```

And webhook should point there.

# 🔎 Tell Me This:

Inside your Replit project:

Do you see:

```
server.js
app.js
index.js
```

Or only:

```
src/
public/
package.json
```
