We need to extend the referral system.

Existing Types
OWNER → 25% owner / 5% admin
B2B → 22% B2B / 8% admin
PUBLIC → 15% customer / 15% admin

A) ADMIN DASHBOARD UPDATE
Add new referral type:
OWNERS_B2B

Rules:
Must be linked to existing OWNER referral code.
Owner referral code already generated by admin.
Use type = "OWNERS_B2B".
Referral commission logic for OWNERS_B2B is same as B2b(22% B2B / 8% admin)

Admin → B2B Tab

Add new tab:
Generate code for Owners_B2B

Form same as Generate B2B form.

Add at top:
Field: Enter Owner Referral Code
Button: Verify

On Verify:
Validate owner referral code (type = OWNER).

If valid:
Show Property Owner Name (readonly)

If invalid:
Show error.

Then allow:
B2B Partner Name
Mobile
Referral Code (auto/manual)
Button: Generate Owners_B2B Code

On Generate:
Create referral:

type = "OWNERS_B2B"
parent_referral_id = owner referral id
owner_id
property_id

Do NOT break existing referral logic.
Use current commission config.

B) OWNER DASHBOARD UPDATE

In Owner dashboard header:
Add new button: B2B (next to Referral button)

On Click:
Show list of OWNERS_B2B linked to that owner.

Display only:
B2B Name
Mobile
Referral Link
QR Code
Delete button

Owner:
Can delete (soft delete only for owner view)
Cannot edit

Important:
Owner delete must NOT remove referral from admin DB.
Only mark as:
visible_to_owner = false

C) ADMIN DASHBOARD UPDATE
1) Referrals Tab

Add new section:
Owners_B2B Referral

List should include:
B2B Name
Mobile
Owner Name
Property Name
Referral Code

Status
If owner deletes from dashboard:
Referral must delete in Admin Referrals tab(but that referral contact number from "Contacts" tab should not be delete because only admin can delete only that contact)

2) Contacts Tab
Add new section:
Owners_B2B Contacts

If owner deletes referral:
Contact must NOT be deleted from Admin Contacts.

DB Requirements
In referral table ensure fields:

type
parent_referral_id
owner_id
property_id
visible_to_owner (boolean default true)
status (active/inactive)

Use soft delete only.

Keep DB scalable.
Follow existing structure.
Do not affect OWNER, B2B, PUBLIC logic.

Implement backend + frontend properly.
