Read carefully and implement EXACTLY as specified.
Do NOT modify existing database schema.
Do NOT sync or copy data between tables unless explicitly stated.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
- properties table:
  - owner_mobile → used ONLY for WhatsApp/webhook communication
- owners table:
  - mobile_number → used ONLY for OTP login
  - owner_name → login-related only

IMPORTANT RULE:
There is NO relation between:
- properties.owner_mobile
- owners.mobile_number
Except logical link via property_id ONLY

They must NEVER be auto-updated or overwritten.

FLOW REQUIREMENTS:

1) Admin creates a property
   - Saves owner_mobile in properties table
   - Generates unique property_id
   - Shares property_id with owner

2) Owner Registration (ONE-TIME ONLY per property_id)
   - Fields:
     - property_id (required)
     - mobile_number 
   - Rule for entering mobile number:
     - mobile_number can be same as admin-added owner_mobile number at the time of property registartion
     - OR may be a NEW number
     - This choice is allowed ONLY ONCE if tried registration again must throw error
   - Validation:
     property_id must exist in properties
     property_id must NOT already exist in owners
   - On success:
     - Insert new row into owners table
     - Store property_id + mobile_number
   - DO NOT update properties table

3) Re-registration Attempt
   - If owner tries to register again using same property_id:
     - Reject with clear error:
       "Owner already registered for this Property ID. Please login."

4) Login Rule
   - OTP login allowed ONLY on:
     - the mobile_number stored in owners table
   - Any other number must be rejected

DATA INTEGRITY RULES:
- NEVER update properties.owner_mobile during owner registration
- NEVER copy owner_mobile into owners table
- Registration allowed ONLY ONCE per property_id
- Enforce DB-level or backend validation to prevent duplicates

OUTPUT:
- Update backend logic only
- Return clear validation errors
- Keep code minimal and clean
